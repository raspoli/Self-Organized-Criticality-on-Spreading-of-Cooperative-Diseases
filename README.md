# Studying-Cooperative-Diseases-by-Self-Organized-Criticality-approach
I study the spreading of two mutually cooperative diseases on lattice by dynamics come from SIRS epidemic models to find that the system can be self-organized critical and following that looking for phase transition behavior in my simulation. I use Drowsel-Shwable self-organized critical forest fire model for my simulation.
